# Advent of Code

Solutions to [Advent of Code] problems.

2017 and 2018 are all done in Scala (technically in [Dotty]). I vaguely aspired to do 2018 in
[Compose], but that didn't happen.

2022 is in [Swift], which I'd never before used in anger. Such an opinionated language.

Maybe next year I'll do it in [Rust].
