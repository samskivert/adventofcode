# Advent of Code

Solutions to [Advent of Code] problems. 2017 and 2018 are all done in Scala (technically in
[Dotty]). I vaguely aspired to do 2018 in [Compose], but that didn't happen. I much more strongly
aspire to do 2019 in Compose.

If for some strange reason you want to actually run them, install [Dotty] and then use the `run.sh`
script in the `2017` or `2018` directories to run any given day. For example:

```
cd 2017
./run.sh 8
```
