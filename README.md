# Advent of Code

Solutions to [Advent of Code] problems. 2017 is all done in Scala, but I aspire to do 2018's
problems in [Compose].

If for some strange reason you want to actually run them, make sure [Scala 2.12] is on your path
(`scala` and `scalac`) and then `./run.sh n` in some date directory `d` for some problem day `n`.
