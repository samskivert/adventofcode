# Advent of Code

Solutions to [Advent of Code] problems.

2017 and 2018 are all done in Scala (technically in [Dotty]). I vaguely aspired to do 2018 in
[Compose], but that didn't happen.

2022 and 2023 are in [Swift]. I rewrote 2022 in [Scala], because Swift was so verbose I wanted to
see how the solutions felt in a less tedious language. Then I also tried rewriting 2022 in [Flix],
but I gave up after seven days because Flix was so annoying.

Note to self: try [Rust] in 2024.
